First and foremost, the ability to recognize and understand natural language is necessary in order to use human speech as a user input for smart appliances. This means that voice recognition or keyword detection technology must be implemented. Security of the collected data is also a major obstacle when using such technology. Modern encryption methods are needed to protect voice data and guarantee the privacy of any sensitive personal or corporate information transferred due to speech recognition.

Using Nordic Thingy:53â€™s advanced sensors and an audio categorization model created and optimized using the Edge Impulse platform, we will demonstrate the design and construction of a system dedicated to integrating basic voice control capability in any device.

The usage of Edge Impulse and the combination with the IoT platform from Nordic Semiconductor create countless opportunities for building smart, user-friendly products. The ability to instantly collect data, create, train, and deploy machine learning algorithms simplify the process for developers, making it easier for them to incorporate these technologies into their applications. This system offers a practical and affordable method for managing numerous home appliances.
